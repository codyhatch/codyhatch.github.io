I'm a multi-talented hacker, coder, devops engineer, and sysadmin.  I'm really quite good at Python, Django, Knockout, Javascript, Coffeescript, CouchDB, Node.js, and Ansible.

I also know a fair bit about MongoDB, Postgres, Unity, Backbone, Chef, Vagrant, HTML, CSS, and a lot of other things.  I'm available for consulting work, short-term or long-term.
